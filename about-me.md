Hi there! Welcome to my star in the internet universe. This is the place where I rant about stuff and reveal my findings.

Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer for [PayPal](https://paypal.com) on their Incentives Platform. I mostly use Python and Java for my work. Sometimes, I like to dabble with JavaScript, C/C++ too. I used to work on random things but mostly related to web, you can follow some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/darxtrix). If you like(or rant about) my work or want to know more about it you can always send me a [mail](darxtrix@gmail.com). I am reasonably nice and typically replies in ~12hours. You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/darxtrix)

I always chase my dreams in search for the mysterious dead end where I can stop but I can't find one as I am a human :D . Never give up because you can control the outcome of your life.
