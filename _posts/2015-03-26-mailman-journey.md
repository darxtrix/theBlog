The race for getting a GSoC project has started yet again. Tomorrow, will be the proposal submission deadline. I have also submitted a proposal for porting the [mailman.client](https://launchpad.net/mailman.client ) to JavaScript.   

For me, GSoC is the reason of starting programming. I have been living for a dream of grabbing a GSoC project for the past 2 years. I hope this time I get one.                                                                         
                                                          
I started contributing to [Mailman](https://launchpad.net/mailman) a month ago. Till now I have found 4 bugs in mailman and have patched all of them; of which two contributions have been merged to the main trunks. Rather being localised I have contributed to almost all members of the Mailman suite except [Hyperkitty]( https://github.com/hyperkitty/hyperkitty ), though I would like to contribute to it someday.  
Coming back to the proposal, I am pretty sure of making to Mailman because I have done a lot of research on the project topic for a couple of weeks and have already started by writing a [Proof of Concept](https://github.com/black-perl/mailman-cli) for the project. My till date contributions can be seen [here](https://launchpad.net/~black-perl). 

Hope ! `black-perl` would make this time.
