Ah ! there came the moment I have been waiting for the past two years. 
The list of accepted projects got published on the [Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2015) website. And, after two months of consistent hard work, I made it. I will be working with an open source organisation called as [GNU Mailman](http://list.org), which is a mailing list management software.

Coming back to my project.  The Mailman project is primarily in [Python](https://www.python.org/). I will be going to port [mailman.client](https://launchpad.net/mailman.client), an existing **Python REST client** for communicating with [mailman-core](https://launchpad.net/mailman) to a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) package i.e a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package.
More on this [here](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/black_perl/5634387206995968).

I will be blogging throughout the summers, as I keep on hacking with Mailman ;-) 
Hang around !!
